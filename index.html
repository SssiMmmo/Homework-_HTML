    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Daniil. In this page I would like to tell about myself.<br>
    There are some blocks with different information, something like education, hobbies, pets,
    the courses I'm taking now and the courses I plan to take after completing these.<br>
    This website contains three pages: <strong>About Me, Contacts</strong> and <strong>Gallery</strong>.
    Each of these pages will be styled with kitties.</p>

<div class="container" id="education">
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I'm studying at the Odessa Polytechnic National University on the second-year at the Faculty of Cybersecurity.
    <br>This is quite an interesting field that includes topics such as social engineering,
        cybersecurity, ethics and law.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>As for my hobbies, there are only a few left lately.One is the guitar and the other is playing chess.<br>
    I have been playing chess since I was 9 years old,
        and now it has grown from a regular hobby into a full-time job. </p>

    <h3>Courses</h3>
    <p>Courses currently in progress: <strong>QA Manual</strong><br>
    Courses that are planned: <strong>QA Technical Pro</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong><br>
    The course I'm taking now has quite a lot of new but interesting information.
