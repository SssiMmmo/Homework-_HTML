    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Daniil. In this page I would like to tell about myself.<br>
    There are some blocks with different information, something like degree, hobbies, pets,
    the courses I'm taking now and the courses I plan to take after completing these.<br>
    This website contains three pages: <strong>About Me, Contacts</strong>and <strong>Gallery</strong>.
    Each of these pages will be styled with kitties.</p>
