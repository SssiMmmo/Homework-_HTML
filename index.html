    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Daniil. In this page I would like to tell about myself.<br>
        There are some blocks with different information, something like education, hobbies, pets,
        the courses I'm taking now and the courses I plan to take after completing these.<br>
        This website contains three pages: <strong>About Me, Contacts</strong> and <strong>Gallery</strong>.
        Each of these pages will be styled with kitties.</p>

<div class="container" id="education">
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I'm studying at the Odessa Polytechnic National University on the second-year at the Faculty of Cybersecurity.
        <br>This is quite an interesting field that includes topics such as social engineering,
        cybersecurity, ethics and law.
    </p>

<div class="container" id="hobbies">
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>As for my hobbies, there are only a few left lately.One is the guitar and the other is playing chess.<br>
        I have been playing chess since I was 9 years old,
        and now it has grown from a regular hobby into a full-time job. </p>
</div>
<div class="container" id="courses">
    <h3>Courses</h3>
    <p>Courses currently in progress: <strong>QA Manual</strong><br>
        Courses that are planned: <strong>QA Technical Pro</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong><br>
        The course I'm taking now has quite a lot of new but interesting information.
        Perhaps the hardest thing to memorize was the technical documentation)</p>
</div>
<div class="container" id="pets">
    <h3>Pets</h3>
    <p>Two cats live at home and have long become part of daily life.
        Cats have always been appealing for their independence and character.<br>
        But when it comes to dreams, having a raccoon as a pet would be interesting.
        This energetic and clever creature seems like a fascinating choice for a companion.</p>
